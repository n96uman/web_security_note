- Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users.

### Some basic examples of information disclosure are as follows:

- Revealing the names of hidden directories, their structure, and their contents via a `robots.txt` file or directory listing
- Providing access to source code files via temporary backups
- Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages
- Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details
- Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, database credentials, and so on in the source code
- Hinting at the existence or absence of resources, usernames, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior.
